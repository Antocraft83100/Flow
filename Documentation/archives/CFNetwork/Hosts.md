pointed to by the info pointer) for debugging purposes. This callback is called by the CFCop
Description(_:) function.
var info: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?

TRUE if the resolution was started (asynchronous mode); FALSE if another resolution is already in
progress for theHost or if an error occurred.
This function retrieves the information specified by info and stores it in the host.
In synchronous mode, this function blocks until the resolution has completed, in which case this
function returns TRUE, until the resolution is stopped by calling CFHostCancelInfo
Resolution(_:_:) from another thread, in which case this function returns FALSE, or until an
error occurs.
This function is thread safe.
