An App Clip gives people quick access to a particular workflow in your app, even when a person
hasn’t installed your app. NFC readers, App Clip Codes, or QR codes define an invocation URL tha
specifies which App Clip, or workflow within your full app, the system needs to run. If you want to
support invocations from your website or support iOS 16.3 and earlier, enable the system to verify
your App Clip. The system’s verification checks that the App Clip includes the URL in its code
signature as the Associated Domains Entitlement, which cites the invocation URL’s
domain. The system also verifies that the server of the domain agrees to launch the App Clip, by
citing the App Clip within an Apple App Site Association (AASA) file that it hosts.
Note
If you don’t support iOS 16.3 and earlier, don’t plan to support all invocations, and don’t have a
website to associate with your App Clip, you may be able to keep your invocations to the
default URL that App Store Connect generates. For more information, refer to Configuring App
Clip experiences.

To associate your app and App Clip with your website:
Specify your invocation URL’s domain within an Associated Domains Entitlement on
both your app and App Clip targets in Xcode.
Add or modify an AASA file on the domain’s server.
The system verifies that both the entitlement and the configuration in the AASA file match before 
permits the invocation of the App Clip. App Store Connect also verifies the match when you creat
an App Clip experience; for more information, refer to Set up an App Clip experience.
Tip
You may already be familiar with the Associated Domains Entitlement if your app
supports Handoff or universal links. If you’re new to using this entitlement and universal links,
read Allowing apps and websites to link to your content and Supporting universal links in your
app. For additional information about the Associated Domains Entitlement — including
cache policies — read Supporting associated domains.
To associate your App Clip with your website, you must add the Associated Domains
Entitlement to the app and the App Clip targets.
First, open your project in Xcode; then, in your project settings, enable the Associated Domains
capability to add the Associated Domains Entitlement.
Second, for each URL that launches your App Clip or full app, add its domain to the Associated
Domains capability using the pattern: appclips:<fully qualified domain>. For example,
add appclips:example.com or appclips:appclip.example.com. Make sure to only
include the desired subdomain and the top-level domain. Don’t include a trailing slash (/), wildca
(*), or path and query components in the URL. For more information, refer to Supporting
associated domains.
In addition to adding the Associated Domains Entitlement to your Xcode project, you nee
to make changes to your server to associate your App Clip with your server and allow the system 
verify the URL that tries to invoke your App Clip.
First, create an AASA file as described in Supporting associated domains. Next, add an entry for
the App Clip with the appclips key to the file.
The following code shows the content to add. Note how the value for the apps key is an array tha
contains the app identifier of the App Clip. In many cases, the array contains only one entry.

However, it can contain entries for multiple App Clips.
Important
For apps that detect App Clip Codes in AR, add an entry for the parent app identifier. For more
information, refer to Interacting with App Clip Codes in AR.
Then, add the AASA file to your website’s .well-known directory. If you previously added an
AASA file to your server, add the entry for the appclips key to the existing file.
Note
If you plan to use multiple invocation URLs with different domains, remember to add an AASA
file to each domain’s .well-known directory. In addition, remember to add each domain to
the Associated Domains Entitlement.
Finally, to make sure the system can validate the association between your App Clip and the AASA
file on your server, check your server’s configuration and make sure it allows AASA-Bot and
CFNetwork as user agents.
App Store Connect verifies the AASA file configuration of your App Clip after you’ve uploaded a
build to App Store Connect and created an App Clip experience. To check the verification status:
1. Open App Store Connect in your browser and navigate to a build’s details page.
2. Click View Status in the App Clip section to show the domain validation status. It shows the
validation status for each domain that’s associated with your App Clip.
For example, you could configure the default App Clip experience to use https://example.co
as its invocation URL and configure an advanced App Clip experience to use https://appclip
.example.com. In this example, you’d place an AASA file in the .well-known directories for
each URL’s domain, and App Store Connect would show the verification status for both domains.
Check the validation status of your App Clip

The Cache Status column shows the validation status for your App Clip as the system performs th
validation on people’s devices. As you develop your App Clip, you may make frequent changes to
your AASA file. To check the verification status in real time, click Load Debug Status in the modal
view that shows the verification status of your App Clip. If a configuration error occurs, App Store
Connect shows information about the error in the Debug Status column.
